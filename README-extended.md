### get-ld-buddies

For each seed SNP (usually a GWAS lead SNP) used for colocalization testing, get a list of
all SNPs in LD (R^2 > 0.8), representing other potentially causal SNPs at the locus.

### get-vep-consequences

Get the VEP predicted effects of every lead variant or LD buddy of a lead variant.
This may be useful for hypothesizing about possible mechanisms at any given locus.
